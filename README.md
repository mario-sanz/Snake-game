# Snake game #
Classical Snake game using [Pygame][pygame]

[Snake][snake] is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 420 Snake-like games for iOS alone.


# About my code #

I have developed it with comments so that everyone with a basic knowledge of Python can follow and understand the code.
No previous knowkedge of Pygame is required to understand it since it is very intuitive.
